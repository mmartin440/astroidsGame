<h1>Astroids</h1>
<p>Asteroids, a classic arcade game, immerses players in a fast-paced, space-themed shooter experience. Piloting a triangular spaceship, your mission is to destroy drifting asteroids and enemy UFOs while avoiding collisions. As you navigate the asteroid field, your ship's laser cannons provide the means to blast these cosmic hazards into smaller pieces, accumulating points with each successful hit. The game's simple yet addictive gameplay, coupled with challenging levels and ever-increasing difficulty, has made Asteroids a timeless favorite among gamers, proving that retro can be just as thrilling as modern titles.</p>

<h1>Experience</h1>
<p>I recreated the classic Asteroids game using React for several reasons. First and foremost, it was a personal challenge to test my programming skills and see if I could replicate this iconic project in a modern web development framework. React, known for its component-based architecture and reactivity, presented an intriguing platform for such an endeavor.

During the development process, I encountered numerous challenges. One of the most significant obstacles was optimizing the game's speed performance. The original Asteroids game relied on a simpler system, while React's component updates and rendering cycles introduced complexities that affected the game's fluidity. I had to fine-tune various aspects, from rendering to state management, to ensure a seamless gaming experience.

Despite the hurdles, the project taught me valuable lessons in optimization and the intricacies of game development within a framework like React
